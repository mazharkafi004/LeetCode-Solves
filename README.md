## Structure

The repository is organized in the following structure:
- .github/workflows
- problems
  - 3some
    - solution.cpp
  - two-sum
    - solution.java
  - ...
- README.md
- LICENSE 
All the problem folders are located within the `problems` directory. Each problem folder is named after the problem it solves and contains the corresponding solution file.

## Solutions

The solutions provided in this repository are stored within the problem folders. Each problem folder contains a solution file named `solution` with the appropriate file extension based on the programming language used.

For example, if a problem is named "3some" and the solution is written in C++, the structure would look like this:
- problems
  - 3some
    - solution.cpp
  - two-sum
    - solution.java
  - ...



## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and navigate through the different problem folders to find the solutions. If you are interested in a specific problem, locate the corresponding folder within the `problems` directory. Inside the problem folder, you will find the solution file.

To run or test a solution, ensure that you have the necessary programming language environment set up on your local machine. You can then access the code from the solution file and execute it within your preferred development environment or compiler.

## Contribution

As of now, I'm the sole contributor to this repository. However, I welcome contributions from the community! If you have a better or more efficient solution to any of the problems, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.
